## Corn Dataset

- **File**: `m5_corn.excel`
- Contains spectral data for corn samples

## Wheat Dataset

The wheat dataset consists of four instrument variations (A1, A2, A3, A4), provided in the following files:

- A1 : `Cal_ManufactureA1.excel`
- A2 : `Cal_ManufactureA2.excel`
- A3 : `Cal_ManufactureA3.excel`
- A4 : `Test_ManufactureA.excel`

Each file corresponds to a specific instrument manufacturer configuration used in the wheat analysis experiments.
